#The tool {x} will match exactly x repetitions of character/character class/groups.

# For Example:

# w{3} : It will match the character w exactly 3 times.
# [xyz]{5} : It will match the string of length 5 consisting of characters {x, y, z}. 
# For example it will match xxxxx, xxxyy and xyxyz.
# \d{4} : It will match any digit exactly 4 times.

# Task

# You have a test string S .
# Your task is to write a regex that will match S using the following conditions:

# S must be of length equal to 45.
# The first 40 characters should consist of letters(both lowercase and uppercase), or of even digits.
# The last 5 characters should consist of odd digits or whitespace characters.

Regex_Pattern = r'[a-zA-Z02468]{40}[13579\s]{5}$'	# Do not delete 'r'.
